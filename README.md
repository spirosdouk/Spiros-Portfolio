# Spiros-Portfolio

Spiros Portfolio: This project is a comprehensive display of my web development projects and experience , built using Next.js(ideas for extending it thats why) and React. Designed to showcase my abilities to potential employers and collaborators, it features a clean, responsive design.

And then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
